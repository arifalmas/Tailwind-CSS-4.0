Tailwind CSS 4.0: Everything you need to know in one place 

游늷 Tailwind CSS 4.0 introduces significant updates to speed up and simplify web development. With the new Oxide engine, it's faster, and it brings several new features and improvements:

# Key Changes from Previous Versions:
  游릭 Removal of deprecated utilities. </br>

  游릭 No default border color, and rings changed to 1px by default.

# A New Engine, Built for Speed: </br>
The newest version of Tailwind CSS, version 4.0, has something called the Oxide engine. Think of it like putting a faster engine in a car - it makes everything run quicker. This engine is made with parts from Rust, a programming language known for speed, and works with Lightning CSS to make building your website faster.

Some of the speed boosts you'll notice include:

  游릭 It's quicker to get rid of unused styles. </br>
  游릭 It can do more work at once because it uses all the cores in your computer's processor. </br>
  游릭 When you make changes, it updates the styles faster.

By using Rust and improving how it's built, Tailwind CSS 4.0 is all about making your work smoother and quicker.

# Unified Toolchain:

With Tailwind CSS 4.0, you don't have to mess around with setting up your CSS tools separately. It's got Lightning CSS built right in, which takes care of things like:

  游릭 Handling @import so you can bring in styles from other files easily. </br>
  游릭 Automatically adding browser-specific prefixes to your CSS so it works everywhere.</br>
  游릭 Letting you nest styles within styles, which can make your code cleaner. </br>
  游릭 Making sure your CSS works on older browsers too.

  This makes working with Tailwind CSS easier because it does a lot of the setup work for you.

  # Designed for the Modern Web:

  Tailwind CSS 4.0 is made to work with the latest web design features:

  游릭 Native cascade layers- Helps avoid issues where styles conflict.</br>
  游릭 Explicitly defined custom properties - Makes it easier to change how things look when they transition.</br>
  游릭 color-mix for opacity - Lets you adjust how see-through colors are with less fuss. </br>
  游릭 Container queries - Allows your design to adapt better to different screen sizes.

  And there's more new stuff on the way that'll make designing for the web even better.
